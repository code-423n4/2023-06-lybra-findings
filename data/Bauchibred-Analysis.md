# Lybra Finance Analysis Report

## Approach taken in evaluating the codebase

- Started with the docs
- Then the codes in scope line by line
- Took a brief look at other contracts not in scope
- Back to the docs to counter some notes I made while going through codebase
- Discussed a few ideas with sponsors to understand their design choice and why I think it's risky or how I can recommend a better method to implement the strategies
- Finally then back to the codebase to sum up my reports/findings
  NB: I don't write my reports on the last day, but rather a few each day while working on a contest, so on the last day I must have gotten more context of the project and can then edit a few reports, finalize others or let them be, more of as the situation calls

## Anything that you learned from evaluating the codebase

Multiple things, to list a few:

- LSDs
- How to properly integrate rebase and non-rebase mechanisms
- EIP 6372
- Tellor
- Have a brief picture of OFTs and LayerZero (would have to spend more time to really understand this)

### Refresher on previously acquainted things

Got a deeper understanding of formerly acquainted topics like:

- Oracle heartbeats
- How block times could be as low as 0.8s on Fantom
- A few basic solidity & defi concepts

## Any comments for the judge to contextualize your findings

I believe I approached the contest first as a learning opportunity and then submit issues I believe should be looked on, I spent around 20 - 24 hours spread around 4/5 days on the contest, had over a day break inbetween, and being relatively new to audit contests (~ 3 months), I might have wrongly specified the severity of an issue, but I'm sure you would fix that, and in all these I would be waiting for the comments on my findings to find out what I can improve in my reports or why my thought process is wrong.
Finally, appreciate you and C4 for giving new auditors the opportunity to learn, improve as auditors and earn at the same time.

### Time spent:
20 hours
