Malicious users could buy  ELSBR tokens that are lost due to premature redemption without paying anything.The contract ProtocolRewardsPool implements a function grabElsbr() which is used to buy elsbr tokens that are lost due to premature redemption at a discount rate.the function calculates the amount to burn as (amount*grabFeeRatio)/10000 {This could result in users getting elsbr tokens  without losing any tokens when the numerator i.e the current grabFeeRatio=3000, so when 0<amount>=3.33}.This could be very problematic since the ELsbr tokens are not inflationary and also used for governing the lybra protocol{Use to make policies}, the amount lost could also increase as grabFeeRatio is decremented.
Recommendation:Add a precision to correctly ensure that there are no edge cases when calculating the LBR tokens to burn.
