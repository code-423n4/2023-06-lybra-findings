                         ABOUT THE PROTOCOL

     
 In summary,
the Lybra Finance is a Defi protocol that deals with LSD/LST.
 It focuses on the stability of the cryptomarket, as it employs the use of the stablecoin, eUSD for its Liquidity Staking Token. The protocol is to run in both the mainnet and L2s. peUSD is a non-rebasing defi-optimized version of the eUSD which is used to like the protocol to the supported L2s. The protocol supports the borrowing of peUSD, using WbETH as collateral. It also supports staking of eUSD which is stored as the users share in the protocol in which they earn rewards.
          
                         AUDITING
 In auditing the codebase, I looked especially at the ways inwhich funds can enter the contracts and also the situations inwhich funds can be withdrawn or taken from the contracts. Also looked at the Control Effects Interaction of the contracts, evaluated loops and checked the effects of modifiers.

                       LESSIONS LEARNT DURING THE AUDITING PROCESS
During the process of auditing the codebase, I came to understand Defi better and it threw light on my shortcommings as a auditor and the areas inwhich I still need to do thorough research on. In general the process brought an alround improvement as it uses some concepts which I wasn't very conversant with and I had to research them to understand better. I hope to work on and improve my skillset as an auditor.
