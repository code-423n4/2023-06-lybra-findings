* Approach taken in evaluating the codebase
  * Was looking directly to the part which interacts with the Lido, since I do have a little experience working with that protocol.

* Anything that you learned from evaluating the codebase
  * N/A

* Any comments for the judge to contextualize your findings
  * I didn't provide full PoC for the findings, but in order to save some time for judge/pre-sort, i've included the test contract that will highlight the finding. Just deploy it on Goerli and verify the context. 

Thanks!
