the codebase was clean and understandable for me expected the rewards contracts that the team didn't including enough comments in the codebase and the reward contracts was not explained well in their docs, others was clean and the team was active to answer all my questions. the code depend on calculating and returning the price of LST token by their contracts(LST contract) and  i recommend to avoid this in future because some user can manipulate the prices by sending tokens to the LST contracts(for example compound return the price rate using borrow rate) so if any LST do the same the price have the risk to face this problem. and i recommend the team to take a highly care about the flash loans because the flash loan may cause many problem if this protocol interacting with another protocols. I spend 25-30 hours on this codebase and hope the best for the team and the protocol.

note to the judge: my reports may include some typo and hope the judge not decrease the quality because of this


good luck to everyone and to the c4 team
