The approach that I have taken in evaluating this codebase is similar to other codebases, I read the code at a very low level at first to see if there are any inconsistencies in the codebase or logic flaws then I try to understand it as effective as possible from a high level perspective to see if the implementation is done right.
From this codebase I have learned Liquity price feed contract works and how the value that the `fetchPrice` function looks and also the way different Ethereum like tokens, RETH/BETH/WstETH/StETH, work.
