## Code Review

I reviewed the entire codebase, examining the logic, structure, and syntax of the contract. This allowed me to understand the functionality and identify some low issues then I analyzed the codebase for potential gas optimization techniques, looking for areas where gas costs could be reduced without compromising functionality or security. Gas optimization is crucial for efficient contract execution and can help reduce transaction costs for users. I found some areas where gas optimization could be applied and identified a few low-level vulnerability issues.

## Learned
Gas Optimization Considerations: Gas optimization is a critical aspect of smart contract development. While evaluating the codebase, I identified opportunities for gas optimization, which can lead to more efficient contract execution and reduced transaction costs. By optimizing gas usage, contracts can provide a better user experience and be more cost-effective for users.
