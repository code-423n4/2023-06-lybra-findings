## [LOW] Keccak Constant values should used to immutable rather than constant

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Mitigation 

By using immutable variables, the Keccak256 hash is computed at contract deployment time rather than at compilation time. This means that the value can be updated if the algorithm changes in a future compiler version, without breaking backward compatibility. Additionally, it provides better gas optimization, as the Keccak256 hash is computed only once at contract deployment instead of every time the variable is accessed during execution.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Mitigation 

.transfer will relay 2300 gas and .call will relay all the gas. If the receive/fallback function from the recipient proxy contract has complex logic, using .transfer will fail, causing integration issues.Replace .transfer with .call. Note that the result of .call need to be checked.

        _mint(_toAddress, _amount);

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

### Mitigation 

.mint wonâ€™t check if the recipient is able to receive the NFT. If an incorrect address is passed, it will result in a silent failure and loss of asset. OpenZeppelin recommendation is to use the safe variant of _mint. Replace _mint() with _safeMint().

### Mitigation 

Immutables should be in uppercase, it helps to distinguish immutables from other types of variables and provides better code readability.
