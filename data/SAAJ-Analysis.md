# Approach
My first approach towards the Lybra contest was going through automated findings that were carried out as a result of bit race to not look for issues that were already identified.
Afterwards, I started looking for gas optimisation and low/medium severity issues that were not covered so provide some chance of looking for issues that was not covered in automated report.
Then i turn my focus towards medium and high findings by utilising my latest knowledge to have some practical result.

# Learning
My learning from this contest is that a project even if it is small or simple to audit but require high level of knowledge and skills to carry out audit effectively.

# Comments
The project does not provide explanation and details with no documentation attach. Documentation were provided late that also in the discord channel which make it difficult to deep dive. The result is being able to find only 2 medium issues even after spending 36 hours of work.


### Time spent:
