Any user who would pay off other users' debt by rigidRedemption(), should not be able to redeem for more than their deposited collateral if they have a collateral ratio less than 100%.

I have gone through the whole codebase. The code is nicely written. It would have been easier for me to understand the logic if the code had more comments (for eg, comments before each function describing its action).
