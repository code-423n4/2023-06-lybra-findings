Code design is totally messed up ,no conventions is followed using writing the code  developers must thoroughly test the code before deploying no many how much audit performed bad design always be hackable.  With proper solidity style guide change the structure of contracts. Make Gas efficient code while writing code gas and security doesn't took into consideration. Lot of precision loss possibilities and division by zero errors. Direct constant numbers are used instead of constant variables . It shows poor design and unexperienced devs wrote the code. Lot of complex calculation always makes contract vulnerable.
